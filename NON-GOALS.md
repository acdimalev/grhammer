Speed
-----

Although this product should be within reason to use, which places an upper
boundary on how slow it can be, it is not intended to be particularly fast at
parsing.  There are plenty of parsers which are quite fast, and implementation
in a systems language would be a good way of trying to compete.  This product is
intended for learning, and will often err on the side of terseness at the
expense of speed.
