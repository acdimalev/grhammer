Grammar Hammer
==============

An experiment in implementing a simple parsing library with utilities for
property testing.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acdimalev/grhammer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acdimalev/grhammer)

Please mind the [non-goals](NON-GOALS.md).

This project is early-alpha, documentation is sparse, and interfaces are
expected to rapidly change.  The primary goal of this project is the be useful
for both education and early adoption of parsing.


Status Update
-------------

Parsers are mostly in-place.  Document generation is way too slow.  Profiling
has become a strong requirement... because document generation is way too slow.
Upcoming... more parsers, grammar logic, refactoring entropy, documentation.
